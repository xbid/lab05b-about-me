# AboutMe

## lab05b-about-me

*I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app.*

First what i did is i created an about me webpage for the project starting from 
**Lab: 02** - About Me, with a guessing game.

now iam extending the project in **Lab: 03** - Extend your 'About Me' and guessing game by adding new quizes.

I did the (**Lab: 05b** - Finish and deploy your About Me) not by my own i was practicing on doing it professional and to know more about the classes beside i liked this style very much and styling generally and because i used to watch this guy and others here is the link [Udemy, Jordan Hudgens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bMdjkfvONE).

Notes:I did it by my own at first but there was a lot of mistakes when ever i fix one another one show up.
